# Machinuino
Code generator for microcontrollers

## Project
Develop a representation and description language for Moore Machines and a Compiler to generate code for microcontrollers from this representation.

### Objectives
- Help in automation and implementation of embedded projects;
- Provide a rapid prototyping mechanism for microcontrollers applications;
- Provide a visualization mechanism to foresee the behavior of the project and help in the error spotting.

### Platforms
- Arduino

## To Do
- [ ] Create a suitable development environment for the project (GitHub Hooks (Travis CI) and other technologies);
- [X] Determine the Moore Machine representation to be used (language);
- [ ] Create a grammar for the language;
- [ ] Develop the syntactic analyzer;
- [ ] Develop the semantic analyzer;
- [ ] Generate code for the target platforms;
- [ ] Make a visualization mechanism for the Moore Machine states.

## Extras
- [ ] Design a logo;
- [ ] Update/finalize the README.md to share this repository;
